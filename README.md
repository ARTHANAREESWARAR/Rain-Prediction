This project is a Rainfall Prediction System that uses Machine Learning to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The system is built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn, and provides predictions through a simple web interface.

𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬

  Data Input: Users can input various weather parameters like humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc.
  Prediction: The system predicts whether it will rain the next day based on the input data.
  Machine Learning Model: A trained Random Forest Classifier is used to perform predictions.
  Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask.
  API Integration: Capable of serving predictions via API endpoints.

  𝐈𝐧𝐩𝐮𝐭: Users input relevant weather features (e.g., temperature, wind speed, humidity).
  𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥: The Random Forest model takes these inputs and predicts the likelihood of rainfall for the next day.
  𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭: The result is displayed on the web interface, indicating whether rain is expected.

  > Improve the accuracy of the model by fine-tuning the hyperparameters.
  > Add additional weather parameters for better prediction accuracy.
  > Deploy the project on a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.
  > Implement a more user-friendly front-end with real-time weather data integration.
